> **GhostMesh** is the next-generation open mesh VPN platform:  
> Fast, secure, modular — with true cross-platform support and modern protocol design.
> 
> - 🔒 **Zero trust, peer-to-peer encrypted**
> - ⚡ **QUIC transport for blazing performance**
> - 🔗 **WireGuard protocol core for proven security**
> - 🌐 **Automatic NAT traversal (ICE/STUN/TURN)**
> - 🤝 **No cloud lock-in — bring your own nodes, relays, and keys**

## Why GhostMesh?

Traditional VPNs and mesh networks are slow to adapt to modern networks and complex firewalls.  
GhostMesh combines the best of open-source mesh networking, using **QUIC** for ultra-fast transport and **WireGuard** for proven cryptography, with robust ICE/TURN fallback to punch through the toughest NATs and firewalls.

**Whether you’re a power user, sysadmin, gamer, or privacy geek:**  
GhostMesh is designed to *just work* — fast, private, portable, and easy to hack on.

## Features

- 🚀 **QUIC-first mesh networking** (UDP multiplexing, mobile-optimized)
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Zero-trust design** — every node is authenticated and encrypted
- 🛠 **WireGuard protocol compatibility** for device interoperability
- 🌍 **Peer-to-peer and relay fallback** using ICE/TURN standards
- 🛡 **Advanced firewall & routing control** (per-app, per-route policies)
- 📱 **Cross-platform:** Linux, macOS, Windows — more coming
- 🧩 **Modular architecture:** CLI, daemon, GUI, relay all as standalone components

---

## Quick Start

Coming soon.  
(Detailed install instructions, usage, and configuration will live in [DOCS.md](./DOCS.md) and [COMMANDS.md](./COMMANDS.md).)

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Core: QUIC+WireGuard tunnel implementation
- [ ] Coordination server (GhostGate) with secure auth
- [ ] Smart peer discovery with ICE/STUN/TURN fallback
- [ ] CLI & GUI clients
- [ ] Configurable relay (TURN) for full mesh support
- [ ] Multi-platform packaging
